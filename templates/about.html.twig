    <h1>About TheCocktailAPI</h1>
    <p>TheCocktailAPI is the result of the course project I did for <a href="//github.com/laurielim/REACT21K_REACT_JS">my React JS classes</a>, and draws from <a href="//github.com/laurielim/REACT21K_PHP">my PHP classes</a> which is all part of the
        <a href="//en.bc.fi/qualifications/full-stack-web-developer-program/">Full Stack Web Developer Program</a> at Business College Helsinki. This is a full stack project. The front-end is
        <a href="//github.com/laurielim/REACT21K_REACT_JS_PROJECT">built with React</a> and the backend is <a
                href="//github.com/laurielim/REACT21K_PHP_PROJECT">built with Symfony</a>.</p>
    <p>The initial idea was to make a website for cooking recipes. However I wanted to make use of <a href="//www.thecocktaildb.com/">TheCocktailDB</a> which is an open, crowd-sourced database of drinks and cocktails from around the world. Based on this, I designed
        <a href="//www.figma.com/file/qVjZ8IDxZnayehZwQBCsev/TheCocktailApp?node-id=0%3A1">the app on Figma</a>. As I was developing the website, the project requirements evolved and we were tasked with creating our own backend and API.</p>
    <p>Hence this website was created. As a supporter of the open web, I want this work to be accessible to others and hopefully someone will find it useful. I've drawn inspiration from the
        <a href="//pokeapi.co/">Pok√©API</a> which I have used before to make a <a href="//codepen.io/laurielim/pen/PoWVmgV">Pokedex on codepen</a>. I chose to limit the initial recipes to the
        <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IBA_official_cocktails">list of IBA official cocktails</a> for the sake of simplicity.</p>
    <p>A lot of pictures are from
        <a href="//unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a> where I started looking. I used a lot of pictures from <a href="//unsplash.com/@cocktailbart">Johann Trasch</a> whom I eventually messaged. He kindly gave me permission to use his pictures from his own website about cocktails,
        <a href="//cocktailbart.de/">cocktailbart.de</a>. Check it out, it's great! Even if you don't speak German, google chrome neatly translates the website.</p>
    <p>Please checkout <a href="//laurielim-thecocktailapp.netlify.app">TheCocktailApp</a> and read more about the whole project on
