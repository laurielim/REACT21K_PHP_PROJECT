# React Project API

This repo contains the backend of the [React project](https://github.com/laurielim/REACT21K_REACT_JS_PROJECT) I did for my React JS course which is part of the Full Stack Web Developer Program at [Business College Helsinki](https://en.bc.fi/qualifications/full-stack-web-developer-program/). It is built with Symfony which we learnt in the [PHP course](https://github.com/laurielim/REACT21K_PHP).

The local db runs on SQLite and the hosted version used Heroku Postgres. Unfortunately, Heroku has removed the free plan of Heroku Postgres so I have taken down the instance.

## Technologies used

Built with:

- PHP
- Symfony
- Postman

Previously hosted on:

- Heroku

## Setup and Usage

You must have PHP and composer installed. Run the following command:

```bash
composer install
```

## Sources

- I created my API and data structure based on the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/)
- I used the [Recipe Schema.org Markup Generator](https://webcode.tools/generators/json-ld/recipe) to structure my recipes.
